Welcome to PYHANDLE's documentation!
====================================

PyHandle is a Python client library for interaction with a `Handle System <http://www.handle.net/>`_ server, providing basic create, read, update and delete capabilities for Handles.
The library offers a client for the HTTP REST interface, a client that interacts directly with a Handle server SQL back-end and a client to manage batch files.

.. important::
   In order to perform operations on Handles it is mandatory to select which client you want to work with.
   There are currently three interfaces to interact with Handle System server: The REST interface, the native (SQL)
   database and the BATCH interface (see :doc:`pyhandleclient`).
