# PYHANDLE
PyHandle is a python library for interaction with HANDLE system. 

PyHandle was first developed in the [EUDAT project](https://eudat.eu) under the name B2Handle.
As [B2Handle](https://github.com/EUDAT-B2SAFE/B2HANDLE) was developed with a specific scope - Handle operations in the EUDAT project - in mind, it has been improved and made more generic to cater to a broader audience.
PyHandle will soon be available on PyPi.
