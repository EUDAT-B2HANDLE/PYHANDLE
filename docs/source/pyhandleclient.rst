PyHandleClient
==============


PyHandleClient is the main class of the PyHandle library and provides methods to:

 * select a client (REST, DB or Batch)
 * authenticate to the Handle System server
 * invoke methods to create, retrieve, update and delete Handles

Select a client
===============

PyHandleClient acts as a factory that takes arguments to determine what type of client to instantiate.
There are two interfaces to interact with the Handle System server: REST, DB or Batch.
User selects the client by passing the client as String to the PyHandleClient class and if required by the client more parameters.

.. code:: python

   from pyhandle.handleclient import PyHandleClient

and then:

* REST

.. code:: python

   client = PyHandleClient('rest')

* DB

.. code:: python

   client = PyHandleClient('db', credentials)

* Batch

.. code:: python

   client = PyHandleClient('batch')

Each client has its own methods and rules to authenticate to the Handle server. When some methods of REST client do not require authentication/authorization (see :doc:`pyhandleclientrest`), all methods related to DB or Batch need authorization.

Credentials are mandatory when creating a DB client. In that case, information about the database have to be
passed to the client (see :doc:`pyhandleclientdb`). Authentication within the Batch client is explained in :doc:`pyhandleclientbatch` and can be performed after instantiating the client.
